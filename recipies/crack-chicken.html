    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup Water (or No Sodium Chicken Broth)</li>
        <li>2 lbs Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts* (about 4 8-ounce breasts)</li>
        <li>1 (1 oz) packet Ranch Dressing Mix</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Onion Powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon Dill Weed, dried</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Parsley, dried</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>1 (8 oz) block Cream Cheese (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 cup Cheddar Cheese (shredded, preferably not from a bag)</li>
        <li>8 slices Cooked Thick Cut Bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>3 Green Onions, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Salt (Taste first and add if desired)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you cook your bacon in the pot, just set the bacon aside to cool, and wipe out the pot. Continue with recipe.</li>
        <li>Add the broth to the inner liner pot of the pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken breasts to the pot, try not to overlap, or as little as possible for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the ranch dressing mix over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, parsley, pepper, and smoked paprika over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Break the block of cream cheese up into chunks and add to the pot.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and set the steam release knob to the Sealing position.</li>
        <li>Press the Pressure Cook/Manual button or dial, then the +/- button or dial to select 12 minutes. High Pressure. The pot will take several minutes to come to pressure. Thicker chicken breasts need more cook time, increase time to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the cook cycle has finished, turn off the pot and let it sit undisturbed for 10 minutes (10 minute natural release). Then turn the steam release knob to the Venting position to release any remaining steam/pressure.</li>
        <li>When the pin in the lid drops back down, open the lid and remove the chicken breasts to a plate or large bowl.</li>
        <li>The mixture may look just a little watery, but it will not stay that way. If it seems too watery (this might be the case if you used frozen chicken or chicken that is injected with water) you can spoon out some of the water.</li>
        <li>Whisk the cream cheese liquid left in the pot. Then gradually whisk in the cheddar cheese until it melts.</li>
        <li>Using two forks, shred the chicken and add it back into the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the bacon and green onion to the pot and stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Taste first, and add salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve on buns, or over rice, or with pasta.</li>
    </ol>
